Irreversible Thermodynamics
***************************

This module was developed in order to form a simple constitutive model for steel deformation under stress.
This compiles a fortran file with the specific model. If you have your own constitutive file, replace 
"irreverisble_thermodynamics.f90" by Dr. Sheng-Yen Li with your own model. If you are running into trouble,
try running the "make fortran" command from your terminal, before running the program.
